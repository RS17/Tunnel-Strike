# Tunnel-Strike
Unity 3D space shooter game.  Hard to control.

This is a game I made in Unity prior to becoming a software developer.

It involves controlling a ship and maneuvering it down a tunnel with obstacles, missiles, and turrets.

Controls:  

WASD – Control spaceship  
Shift/Z – Fire rockets  
Spacebar – Fire guns  
Q/E – Strafe left/right (need vectored thrust)  
Tab – Reorient ship (need reorientator)  
P – Pause/See instructions and options  
R – Rear view camera  
1-5 – Cycle through forward camera views
